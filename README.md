# CS-Fundamentals

This repository contains the implementation of various data structures and algorithms in JAVA. The purpose of this repository is to help myself to learn and understand the fundamentals of computer science. I will be adding more and more data structures and algorithms as I learn them. I will also be adding the explanation of the code in the form of comments. I hope this repository will help you to learn and understand the fundamentals of computer science as well. 

## How to run the code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE
3. Run the `Main.java` file in the `src` folder
