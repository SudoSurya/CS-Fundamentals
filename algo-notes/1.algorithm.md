# whats an algorithm?
an algorithm is a computational procedure that takes an input and produces an output
an algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that are tranform the input into the output

## sorting problem
**Input:** A sequence of n numbers (a1, a2, ..., an)
**Output:** A permutation (reordering) (a1', a2', ..., an') of the input sequence such that a1' <= a2' <= ... <= an'

## what kind of problems are solved by algorithms?
- sorting
- searching
- shortest paths
- scheduling
- etc.

## Data Structures
- a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications

### Examples
lets say  we have two computers

Faster Computer A   | Slower Computer B
--------------------|-------------------
runs insertion sort | runs merge sort
sorts 10millon items| sorts 10million items

- total system performance depends on choosing an efficient algorithm as much as choosing a fast hardware

## comparsion of running times

|   | 1 second | 1 minute | 1 hour | 1 day | 1 month | 1 year | 1 century |
|---|----------|----------|--------|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| n
| lgn
| sqrt(n)
| nlgn
| n^2
| n^3
| 2^n
| n!
